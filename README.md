A bork operated sprinkler system for training naughty doges

I decided to use an MSP-EXP430F5529LP Dev board that I have had lying about for a while.
The project basically uses a condensor microphone to trigger a timer on the MSP430 which operates a relay which in turn operates a water solenoid valve and turns on a sprinkler system to water my garden/dog whenever he barks at passers by.

A simple project to have a look at the MSP430 and get to know it a little better.
